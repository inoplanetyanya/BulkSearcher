## Q&A

**Q:** Is it legal?  
**A:** Yes. Your ip can get temporary block on trade site if you will parallel search something manually and by this app. Similar could happen when you using any trade macros and searching something on trade site. This does not threaten your account in any way.

**Q:** What are the reasons to use it?  
**A:** With new exchange engine you have less reasos to use it. But you still can't filter maps by tiers on official trade site. With this tool you can.

**Q:** Why the search takes too long?  
**A:** The more tier range you setup, the more time needed for searching.

## P.S. Note
